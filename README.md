Memory game built with React. Quantum memory is a simple memory game where users are presented with 10 random generated words and are given 60 seconds to memorize them. After the time passes they are presented with a Quiz of the words they were just shown. The app includes but does not requires user authentication. Users can create an account / log in and their scores will be saved and shown to them after each round.

I built this app as a way for me to exercise my memory muscle & to practice my React and styled components skills.
